DESCRIPTION:
The program starts by prompting the user to enter two numbers. It uses the input() function to get the user's input and the float() function to convert the input to floating-point numbers. This allows the program to handle decimal values as well.
Next, the program prompts the user to choose an operation. The user can enter + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, or / for division. The program uses the input() function again to get the user's choice.
Based on the user's choice, the program performs the selected operation using conditional statements (if, elif, else). For example, if the user chooses +, the program adds the two numbers together using the + operator. Similarly, for subtraction, multiplication, and division, the program uses the corresponding operators -, *, and /.
After performing the selected operation, the program displays the result to the user using the print() function.
The program also includes error handling for division by zero. If the user chooses division and the second number is zero, the program displays an error message instead of performing the division.
Overall, this program provides a basic calculator functionality where the user can enter two numbers, choose an operation, and get the result.

CONCLUSION:
In conclusion, creating a simple calculator in Python is a popular beginner project that allows you to practice fundamental programming concepts. The calculator program prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). It then performs the selected operation and displays the result to the user.
There are various resources available online that provide step-by-step guides and code examples for creating a simple calculator in Python. Some of these resources include tutorials from websites like Programiz, GeeksforGeeks, Shiksha Online, Built In, javatpoint, upGrad, Medium, Juni Learning, and DigitalOcean.
The basic structure of the calculator program involves using input functions to get user input, conditional statements to perform the selected operation, and the print function to display the result. Error handling is also implemented to handle division by zero scenarios.
